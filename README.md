# Go RESTful

A real world production-grade RESTful proof-of-concept project.

## Objectives

- An optimized Go implementation follows clean architecture, provides mechanism to declare entities, use cases - - and external services (e.g. data access).
- An optimized Go implementation provides mechanism to exposes entities and use cases as RESTful web services.
- An optimized Go implementation of token-based authentication and authorization.
- An optimized Go implementation provides abstract mechanism to access relational databases.
- An optimized Go development environment with Git, Docker, Golang/dep, Golang debuggers (GDB/Delve) and editors (VSCode/GoLand).
- A scalable and highly available production deployment solution over AWS cloud using Terraform.
- An optimized staging environment replicating production environment for testing purposes.
- An optimized CI/CD solution with CircleCI and AWS.
- An optimized issues tracking mechanism with Github projects, issues and pull requests.
- Continual improvements.

## Issues Tracking

This project use Github project, issues and pull requests to manage and track issues. Refer to [Go RESTful](https://github.com/the-evengers/go-restful/projects/1) for details.
